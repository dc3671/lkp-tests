A pipe-based notification system

Process will be blocked when executing "wait xxx" until some other processes
execute "wake xxx", where "xxx" is the name of the event and can be any string.

A typical monitor using events:
* includes lib/wait.sh,
* invokes setup_wait,
* waits for a specific event, and
* prints the statistics.
